<!-- emulator -->

<br>
so first we have to get you a emulator to play Pokemon on. <br> 

it's here  <a href="https://visualboyadvance.org/download/1-8-0-beta-3/">emulator download</a><br><br>
you should get a zip file, so extract it till you have this little software <br><br>

when you have that you have a mini gameboy on your pc so congrats. <br><br><hr>


<!-- firered rom  -->

<br>next part is to get your digital pokemon cartridge, its called a ROM on PC. <br>
so first download this to your PC: <a href=
"https://archive.org/details/1636PokemonFireRedUSquirrels">firered rom</a> <br>
<br>
dowload the zip version, and extract it a folder on your desktop <br> 
called 'pokemon with the gang or whatever you want the space to be called. <br>
That folder needs the emulator and the firered rom, you now have both. <br>

<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>

next thing is turning firered into radical red <br> 
Radical red is a fan-made game, made from firered <br>
so we need to patch it onto the firered rom you downloaded. <br>
<br>
here is the automatic patcher for you: <a href="https://patch.radicalred.net/">automatic patcher site</a><br>
just pick version 4.0, should be the latest one,<br>
and just put in your Fire Ref rom called 1636 firered squirells or whatever. <br>
<br>
and it will be done. <br>
now you should rename the Firered Rom in your desktop folder <br>
to 'Pokemon Radical Red' because that's what it is now. <br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
next we play the game haha
